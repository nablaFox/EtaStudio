features:
- models loading and transformations tree
- first person working camera (explore a city model)
- lights
- shadows
- default materials (transparent and others)
- 2D rendering
- computed shaders (particle simulations)
- fonts
- animation system (morph/blend)
- audio system
- shaders compilation

efficiency:

- batching draw calls (octrees and others)
- deferred rendering
- LOD (level of detail) (mipmaps)
- multithreading

code:

- i think that scenes should be separate from assets (sceneManager in unity)
- default materials should be special assets because they have special permissions (can't be modified or deleted)
- gestire la roba delle inclusioni
